# RAG: Outfit Recommendation System

**AI-Driven Outfit Recommendations with Advanced Search Capabilities**

*Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Information Technology Guwahati*

## Abstract

This project delivers a full-stack fashion e-commerce platform that implements advanced outfit recommendations and sophisticated search. Our solution employs architecture with a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** framework that employs state-of-the-art machine learning, including **OpenAI CLIP** for multimodal understanding and **Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)** for diverse recommendations.

## üéØ Motivation

Empower users to discover and explore outfit ideas tailored to their searches, using AI-driven image and text understanding, moving beyond sales to genuine style inspiration and intuitive interaction.

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Approach

### Microservices Architecture
- **Scalable Design**: Breaking the platform into independent services
- **Agility**: Platform design supports parallel development and rapid feature deployment
- **Quick Iterations**: Allowing quick tweaks to features and search algorithms

### Scalability & Resilience
- **Loose Coupling**: Ensures easy integration of components
- **High Availability**: Robust system design for consistent performance

## üöÄ Key Features

### Advanced Search Capabilities
- **RAG Architecture Integration**: Enhances search with information retrieval from the product database
- **Multimodal Embeddings (OpenAI CLIP)**: Generate unified image and text embeddings for deep semantic understanding
- **Cross-Modal Search**: Enable attribute prediction (e.g., garment, article type, color) and cross-modal search functionality

### Intelligent Recommendation Engine
- **TF-IDF**: Weighs textual feature importance for content-based recommendations
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Encodes categorical features for similarity calculations
- **Similarity Search (Annoy)**: Fast Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) search using cosine similarity for real-time recommendations

### Recommendation Strategy
- **MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance)**: Balances relevance and diversity in recommendations
- **K-Means Clustering**: Detects dominant colors for outfit compatibility scoring

## üìä Performance Results

Our system demonstrates significant improvements over baseline models:

| Metric | Value | Improvement |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| NDCG@5 | 0.991 | 15.37% |
| Novelty | 0.947 | 2.85% |

### Industry Comparison
The system shows superior performance compared to existing fashion e-commerce platforms in key areas:
- **Multimodal Search**: Enhanced accuracy in product discovery
- **Personalization**: Improved user experience through AI-driven recommendations
- **Search Quality**: Better semantic understanding and relevance

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

### Machine Learning & AI
- **OpenAI CLIP**: Multimodal embeddings for image-text understanding
